##2 Purchasing Models, Service Tiers, and Hardware CHoices

### Purchasing Models : 

* vCore based or DTU based
* vCore allows independent selection of compute and storage resources. It aalso allws Azure Hybrid benefot for SQL Server and/or reserved capacity which is not available in DTU model.
* DTU is a bundled measure of compute, storage, and I/O resources.

### Service Tiers

* General Purpose - Budget oriented scalable compute and storage options
* Hyperscale - Suitable for applications that need 100TB+ stoarage and have read scale requirements. Only available in single database with Azure SQL
* Business Critical - Suitable for applications that need low latency response. This is the only tier that offers In-Memory OLTP.

### Compute Tier

* Provisioned Compute - Regular usage patterns with higher average compute utilization over time. Provides a fixed amout of resources over time to ensure optimal performance.
* Serverless Copute - Intermittent unpredictable usage patterns. Provides automatic compute scaling and is billed only for the amount of compute used.

### Hardware

* Default is Gen5 Hardware

##3 Management Interfaces for Azure SQL

* Azure Portal
* SSMS
* Azure Data Studio
* Languages and APIs (Azure SQL supports REST APIs for management of SQL managed isntances and SQL databases; All drivers that work with SQL Server also work with Azure SQL)
* CLI (sqlcmd and bcp support; Azure CLI and PS cmdlet support; tools like sqlcmd and az are pre-installed in Azure Cloud Shell)
